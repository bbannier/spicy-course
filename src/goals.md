# Goals of this course

This course gives an introduction to
[Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/), a parser generator
for network protocols and file formats which integrates seamlessly with
[Zeek](https://zeek.org).

After this course you should be comfortable to implement a parser for a given
[RFC](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/) and integrate it with Zeek.
