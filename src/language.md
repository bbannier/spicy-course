# Spicy language

This chapter gives a coarse overview over the Spicy language.

We show a selection of features from the [Spicy reference
documentation](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/programming/index.html),
in particular

- [the chapter on the language](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/programming/language/index.html)
- [the chapter on parsing with Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/programming/parsing.html)

In terms of syntax Spicy borrows many aspects from C-like languages.
